# Blender-Speech-to-Face-Animation-Add-On
WORK IN PROGRESS

This Blender add on let's you input an audio file containing spoken or sung words and turns it into a facial animation. Currently, only FACEIT https://blendermarket.com/products/faceit face rigs are supported.
The user needs to add reference poses for the following phonemes:

"Silent", "PP", "FF", "TH", "DD", "kk", "CH", "SS", "nn", "RR", "aa", "E", "I", "O", "U".

After running the add on, words understood by the add on will get listed and the user gets to make corrections. (This is currently only supported in the Blender console, a simple UI will follow)

Some prerequisites are required for Blender's Python executable. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.
